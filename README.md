# Load-and-Save-Paint
This program adds the save and load function to the Paint Program. It uses file writing and parsing to save the users shapes to a file and also load them when reading a file in the proper format given by the Finite State Machine and Regexes.
NOTE:
The starter code was provided by my professor Arnold Roseblossom at UTM. My code is all the code in PaintFileParser.java, the Save function in View.java and the print() method in RectangleCommand.java, CircleCommand.java and SquiggleCommand.java.
